# Why you designed it like this(navigation,layout,colour choices)
I designed it mainly because I think it is easy to do
# what challenges you faced
There are many challenges I faced.Firstly, I am not good at english, so I met many difficulties by using Google chrome to search relevant code.Secondly, I did not have any experiences for programing and coding, so I spent much time accomplishing this task. Finally, I feel it really difficult to find pictures.
